                            </p>
                            <p>We provide refunds under specific circumstances and conditions, which are elaborated
                                as follows:
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Change of Mind</h5>
                            <p>
                                Customers can receive a 100% refund if they request it before our writers/editors
                                commence work on their project.
                            </p>
                            <p>If, for any reason, you change your mind and decide not to proceed with your project
                                after placing the order, you can request a refund within the first hour. In other
                                cases, a 40% processing fee will be deducted.
                            </p>

                        </li>

                            <h5>Incompetent Delivery</h5>
                            <p>
                                After the work is delivered, customers can request a refund only after they have
                                tried the following options:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the delivered work does not meet the project requirements as initially
                                    requested or documented by the customer. We are dedicated to ensuring 100%
                                    customer satisfaction and provide unlimited revisions to ensure the delivered
                                    work meets your expectations. We will assign, re-assign, and re-write your work
                                    to ensure your satisfaction.</li>
                                <li>You can also reserve an equivalent value of pages for future use, and they will
                                    be available for your use at any time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If, even after these efforts, we cannot deliver what you requested, a refund will be
                                processed with mutual agreement on a predetermined percentage. This will only occur
                                in cases where the delivery is significantly off the mark.</p>

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Late Delivery</h5>
                            <p>
                                We are committed to "On Time Delivery." However, if, for any reason, we cannot
                                provide the requested service on time and after making at least three attempts to
                                contact us, your refund will be processed. This will occur once it is confirmed
                                through documentary evidence that the delayed delivery was the company's fault.

                            </p>

                            <h5>Refund Time Frame</h5>
                            <p>
                                Refunds must be requested within 120 days of the delivery. Any refund claims made
                                after this established timeframe will not be considered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We want to emphasize that all customers should take note of the refund claim
                                deadline at the time of placing their order.
                            </p>

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Cases Where Refund Will Not Be Issued</h5>
                            <p>
                                If a late delivery is caused by minor technical errors like grammatical issues,
                                typing errors, word count discrepancies, or missing references, refunds will be
                                determined through mutual agreement. In such cases, the company will typically offer
                                a partial refund or discounts reserved for future purchases.
                            </p>
                            <p>Please note that the company will not be held responsible for any delays caused by
                                the client.</p>
                            <p>It's important to mention that no refunds will be issued based on the quality of the
                                writing.</p>

                        </li>
