                            We'll also appoint a project manager to oversee everything. You'll then have a scheduled
                            call with the writer to discuss your book. You can easily reach your team through an
                            online portal throughout the process. You can use various communication methods like
                            calls, chats, and recordings to keep in touch.

                            develop.

                            book's development and ensures your satisfaction with the progress.
