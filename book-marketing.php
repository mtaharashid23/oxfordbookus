                    <h3>Advertising</h3>
                    <p>Advertising is a key tool for building recognition. It's about effective communication and
                        showcasing your book's overall appeal. While print advertising has declined in popularity
                        compared to online ads, it still finds a place in platforms like The New York Times. At
                        Oxford Book US, we create targeted advertising campaigns that reach the right
                        audience, helping your book stand out in the crowded market.
