                    <h3>Self-Publishing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Self-publishing empowers authors to take control of their creative work without the need for a
                        traditional publishing house. It provides complete creative freedom, higher royalty rates, and
                        full autonomy over the publishing process. At Oxford Book US, we support authors on their
                        self-publishing journey by offering guidance, services, and tools to ensure your book
                        effectively reaches its audience.

                    <h3>ISBN Acquisition</h3>
                    <p>
                        The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) acts as your book’s ID card in the publishing
                        world. It uniquely identifies your book and enhances its discoverability. Booksellers and
                        libraries use ISBNs to locate books, meaning that having one significantly increases the chances
                        of your book being found and purchased. We assist in obtaining an ISBN, ensuring your book is
                        recognized, cataloged, and easily discoverable.
